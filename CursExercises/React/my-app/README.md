## Why should we use React?

_Fast UI Development:_
React allows for rapid development of user interfaces.
Its component-based architecture makes it easier to manage and reuse UI elements.

_Modular Architecture:_
React promotes a modular approach to building applications.
You can break your UI into small, self-contained components that are easier to develop and maintain.

_Reusable Components:_
React's component-based structure encourages the creation of reusable UI components.
You can use these components across different parts of your application or in multiple projects.

_Performance:_
React's virtual DOM (Document Object Model) efficiently updates only the parts of the UI that have changed,
resulting in faster rendering and improved performance.

_Advanced Debugging Tools:_
React offers a range of debugging tools and extensions that make it easier to identify and fix issues in your application.

_React Native:_
With React Native, you can build native mobile applications for both iOS and Android using the same React components and skills,
reducing development time and effort.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
