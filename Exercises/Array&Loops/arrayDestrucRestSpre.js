// Instructions

// Elyse, magician - to - be, continues her training.
// She has a deck of cards she wants to manipulate.
// To make things easier, she usually only starts with cards numbered 1 to 10,
//     although some of the tricks may involve additional cards.

// 1. Get the first card
// Elyse will summon the first card in the deck without using the array[index] or.shift().
//     It's just like magic.



//  2. Get the second card
// Elyse performs sleight of hand and summons the second
// card in the deck without using the array[index].



//  3. Swap the first two cards
// Elyse will make the top two cards of the deck switch places.
// She doesn't need to call a single function.



//  4. Discard the top card
// Elyse will separate the deck into two piles.The first pile will contain only the top card 
// of the original deck, while the second pile will contain all the other cards.



// 5. Insert face cards
// Elyse will insert a set of face cards(i.e.jack, queen, and king) 
// into her deck such that they become the second, third, and fourth cards, respectively.
